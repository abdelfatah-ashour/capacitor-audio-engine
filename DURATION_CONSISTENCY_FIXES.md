# Audio Recording Duration Consistency Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve consistency issues in audio recording duration handling across both manual and auto interruption scenarios on Android and iOS platforms.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### ❌ **BEFORE:** Inconsistent Duration Behavior

**Problem 1: Non-Critical Interruptions**

- Duration continued incrementing during system notifications, temporary audio focus loss
- Users received inaccurate timing information for usable recorded content
- Different behavior between segment rolling and linear recording modes

**Problem 2: Missing Integration**

- `AudioInterruptionManager` handled interruptions but didn't communicate with duration tracking
- Linear recording mode lacked interruption handling integration
- iOS segment rolling didn't pause duration during non-critical interruptions

**Problem 3: Platform Inconsistencies**

- Android and iOS handled interruptions differently
- Segment rolling vs linear recording had different duration behaviors
- Auto interruptions vs manual pause/resume had inconsistent duration tracking

### ✅ **AFTER:** Consistent Duration Behavior

**Fix 1: Universal Duration Pause During Interruptions**

- **ALL** interruptions now pause duration tracking to reflect actual usable recording time
- Consistent behavior across critical (phone calls) and non-critical (notifications) interruptions
- Duration accurately represents quality recording time, excluding interruption periods

**Fix 2: Integrated Interruption Handling**

- Added `AudioInterruptionManager` integration for linear recording on Android
- Connected interruption events with duration monitoring across all recording modes
- Unified interruption handling approach across platforms

**Fix 3: Platform Consistency**

- Android and iOS now handle duration tracking identically during interruptions
- Segment rolling and linear recording modes have consistent duration behavior
- Manual and auto interruption scenarios follow the same duration tracking logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Android Changes

#### 1. Enhanced SegmentRollingManager

```java
// Added duration tracking state
private final AtomicBoolean isDurationPaused = new AtomicBoolean(false);
private long pausedDurationOffset = 0;
private long pauseStartTime = 0;

// Updated getCurrentDuration() to exclude interruption time
public long getCurrentDuration() {
    long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - recordingStartTime;
    long adjustedElapsedTime = elapsedTime - pausedDurationOffset;
    return Math.max(0, adjustedElapsedTime);
}

// Added duration tracking methods
private void pauseDurationTracking() { /* ... */ }
private void resumeDurationTracking() { /* ... */ }
```

#### 2. Updated Interruption Handling

```java
@Override
public void onInterruptionBegan(AudioInterruptionManager.InterruptionType type) {
    // Pause duration tracking for ALL interruptions
    pauseDurationTracking();

    switch (type) {
        case PHONE_CALL:
            // Pause recording AND duration
            pauseSegmentRolling();
            break;
        case AUDIO_FOCUS_LOSS:
        case SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION:
            // Continue recording but pause duration tracking
            break;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Linear Recording Integration

```java
// Added AudioInterruptionManager for linear recording
private AudioInterruptionManager linearRecordingInterruptionManager;

// Implemented InterruptionCallback interface
public class CapacitorAudioEnginePlugin extends Plugin
    implements AudioInterruptionManager.InterruptionCallback {

    @Override
    public void onInterruptionBegan(AudioInterruptionManager.InterruptionType type) {
        // Pause duration monitor for all interruptions
        if (durationMonitor != null) {
            durationMonitor.pauseDuration();
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Interruption Handling

```swift
switch interruptionReason {
case .phoneCall, .siri:
    log("Critical interruption - pausing recording and duration")
    pauseRecording() // This calls stopDurationMonitoring()

case .systemNotification, .audioFocusLoss, .unknown:
    log("Non-critical interruption - continuing recording but pausing duration")
    // NEW: Always pause duration monitoring
    stopDurationMonitoring()
}
```

#### 2. Improved Resume Logic

```swift
case .ended:
    // Resume recording if it was paused (critical interruptions)
    if !isRecording && isPaused {
        resumeRecording()
    } else if isRecording {
        // For non-critical interruptions, restart duration monitoring
        log("Restarting duration monitoring after non-critical interruption")
        startDurationMonitoring()
    }
```
